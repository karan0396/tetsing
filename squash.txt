What is Git Squash ?
- To "squash" in Git means to combine multiple commits into one. 
- You can do this at any point in time (by using Git's "Interactive Rebase" feature), though it is most often done when merging branches. 
- Please note that there is no such thing as a stand-alone git squash command.
