What is a repository ? and how is it diff from a branch ?
A Git repository is the . git/ folder inside a project. 
This repository tracks all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time. Meaning, if you delete the . git/ folder, then you delete your project's history.
A repository is your whole project (directories and files) that you clone on your computer. 
A branch is a version of your repository, or in other words, an independent line of development. 
A repository can contain multiple branches, which means there are multiple versions of the repository.
